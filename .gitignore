# The "build" and "bundle" directories are used when creating installers
# via the `server', `client', and/or `farm' maefile targets.

/bundle/

# It's common to configure the PLTADDONDIR to be here.
/add-on/

# This is where to put packages installed with `--clone`
/extra-pkgs/

# Everything below makes sense on any package repository, so it's
# stuff that should be put into each such repository. The same holds
# for ".mailmap" (which some people can decide if they want to thin it
# out or not include it) and for ".gitattributes" (which is probably
# irrelevant except maybe for the core repo).
